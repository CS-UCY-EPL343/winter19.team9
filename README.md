# Fitness Factory Nicosia WebApp

This web application is a prototype version of an on going website development for the 
company Fitness Factory Nicosia. At the current state, the web application just serves as 
an indication of the interface of the website in development, however most of the functionality is lacking.
As stated this is an indication of the final product's interface, hence changes might apply during the 
progression of the development process.
